gister
======

Upload code or text files to gist

This necessarily supports both anonymous and signed gist upload. 
It also supports both private and public gists upload.

For now, username and password upload is the only authentication method supported but use of tokens if to be added as soon as i have some more free time, thanks to these present xmas holidays.

For those who are curious, the script should be portable to both python 2.7 and python 3.*

Thank you and please use and add features as you like.
